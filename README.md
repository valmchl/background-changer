# Dynamic Custom Background Changer
An old user favorite feature from an old forum I volunteered at as a Front End Developer.
It was my first experience with jQuery years ago and I've recreated it.

## Features
+ 6 pre-installed images; 5 stylish seamless patterned backgrounds, 1 neutral/reset color
+ Input field for inserting image source links of any image you choose (image will be tiled, repeated pattern)

## Demo
